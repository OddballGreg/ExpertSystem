<- Fact ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fact class is designed to handle the management of dependency and
annullment rules of a Fact defined for a backward chaining inference engine.

Instantiation of a Fact requires the name of the Fact to passed to the
constructor.

Debug messages can be enabled by setting the static public variable "Verbose" 
to TRUE.

Methods:

bool prove($Facts)
-The prove method is used to determine whether a fact is true under the
curently defined rules and constants. It will return true or false depending
on the rules it was given using the methods c_depend and c_anull and the list
of Fact Objects given in the $Facts variable.
Note: This method works recursively through the defined rules of the objects in
order to resolve the query for the initial fact.

c_depend($string)
-This method appends $string to the Fact Object's list of rules which it can
attempt to resolve in order to prove itself as TRUE.

c_anull($string)
-This method appends $string to the Fact Object's list of rules which is can
attempt to resolve in order to prove itself as FALSE.

set_constant()
-This method will set the Fact Object's variable "_constant" to true, which
will be used first to provide resolution when using the prove method.
